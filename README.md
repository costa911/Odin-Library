Odin-Library 
Welcome to the Odin-Library project! https://costa911.github.io/Odin-Library/

Project Overview:
Odin-Library is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage a virtual library of books. Users can add new books by providing details such as title, author, number of pages, and whether they have read the book or not. The application provides a dynamic interface to view the added books and categorizes them as read or unread.

How to Use:
Adding a New Book:

Click on the "New Book" button to open the form.
Fill in the required details such as title, author, pages, and select whether you have read the book or not.
Optionally, you can add a cover image for the book.
Click on the "Add Book" button to add the book to your library.
Viewing Your Library:

Once you've added books, they will be displayed in the library section.
Each book card includes details like title, author, pages, and whether it has been read or not.
If a cover image is provided, it will also be displayed alongside the book details.
Read and Unread Counts:

The left panel dynamically shows the count of read and unread books.
Clicking on the counts will display a list of books categorized accordingly.
